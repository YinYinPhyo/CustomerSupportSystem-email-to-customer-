STEPS INVOLVED IN DEVELOPMENT:
•	STEP 1: Generate customer’s comment.
o	An input of the list of products is given and expect a response of about 100 words as a customer comment.

•	STEP 2: Generate email subject.
o	The comment generated is given as input and expect ChatGPT to generate appropriate subject for the email using Inferring technique.

•	STEP 3: Generate summary of customer comments.
o	Based on the comment, expect ChatGPT generate a summary within 30 words.

•	STEP 4: Sentiment analysis of the customer comment.
o	Take the comment as an input and expect to analyze the sentiment of the comment if it is positive or negative using Inferring technique.
o	Since it gave an output with more than 100 words, I just wanted to know if the comment is positive or negative. So, I changed the prompt accordingly.

•	STEP 5: Generate email.
o	Based on all the comment, subject of email, sentiment and summary, expect to generate an email in the selected language by the user.
